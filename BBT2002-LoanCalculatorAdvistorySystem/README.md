Develop mobile application in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Cordova, jQuery and jQuery mobile libraries.

---------------------------

This is a very simple loan calculator that uses inputs such as loan amount, interest rate, basis of interest (monthly/annually) and loan period to calculate the monthly repayment. It also shows the repayment schedule detailing the month, year, repayment, interest, loan paid and loan balance.

In addition, the calculator provides advise by using the salary and expenses to calculate the debt-to-income ratio to determine if a person has committed to loans beyond what he can repay.
